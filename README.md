# To-do list app âœ…

Creation of a simple task list application, with the intention of trainning the front-end and back-end, using the MVC architecture.

## Project information ðŸ’»

These are the folders that will structure the project:

- `node_modules`: containing all the external modules, such as express or typescript
- `public`: containing the static files
- `src`: the folder to maintain dependencies
    - `controllers`, `models` and `views`, characterizing the MVC arch.

The app have  three views. The initial, with some information and a start button. Next, a view that lists all the task-lists you may have, with the possibility to add and exclude new ones. Click in one of them, and a view to insert and check the tasks will appear. For educational purposes, the project will not initially have a database, so all information will be saved in code.
